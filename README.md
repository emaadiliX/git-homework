# git-homework
This repository contains my homework exercise for #1: Git Workflow and History Management.
### 1. Recovered Commit
For **points 4 and 5** of the homework:  
- The commit that was originally removed and then recovered is:  
  ```
  66771d7 - finalize project
  ```  
- and that is why for **point 6**, the new branch is built on top of that commit.

### 2. Git Alias Used
For **point 7**, the git alias I used is:

```ini
[alias]
    lg = log --oneline --graph --all --decorate
```

#### P.S - The text I used for this homework is taken from (https://www.lipsum.com/).
